# TFS Merge Candidates
A basic Windows application which identifies TFS change sets that can be merged between two branches. (For projects using TFVC source control only).

## Usage

Enter a TFS server URL and select a target and source branch. Results are outputted in the main window:

![Main window](/docs/images/tfsmc-main-window.png)

...and can optionally be outputed to a basic HTML report:

![Build started](/docs/images/tfsmc-report.png)
